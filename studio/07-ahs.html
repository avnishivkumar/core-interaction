      <p><h6 class="column"> American Horror Story is known for its eerie title sequence that changes every season. The opening credits were created by Prologue, a design studio I mention in my earlier articles, which is known for the creation of title sequences such as The walking dead and Star Trek. The show is known for creating small spooky clips and editing them into one long intro so that as the plot progresses, the intro makes more and more sense.  Ryan Murphy, the producer and creator of the show, said "The title sequence is almost like a mystery. By the time you see the last couple episodes of the season, every image in that title sequence will be explained. So for example, What are the jars in the basement? What is the mystery of the floating white Christening dress? Why is somebody holding hedge clippers that are bloody? Each time you watch it and you watch the week's episode you'll be able to say, 'Oh that's why that's in there!’. Another aspect of the title sequence that is very interesting is how the title music always stays the same, however depending on the season, there will be a different backtrack or different sound effects added to the song.  </p> </h6> <h6 id="rightcol" class="column"> For example, in the 4th season titled ‘Freak Show’ there was a circus soundtrack in the background, and in the 3rd season titled ‘Coven’ there was an ghostly woman singing. The song, like the intro, can also gives clues to the plot. For example, the ambient noises and the sound of dripping water along with a whispering by Lady Gaga, provided clues for the premise of ‘Hotel’ the 5th season. Prologue felt it important that the title sequence of the season provides context to the time and place that the season is set in, considering the time and place changes each season. Although the iconic font for the intro stays the same, Rennie Mackintosh, the typography changes. In the season that is set in the 20s the type is displayed in neon lights, while the season that is set in an asylum appears to be shadows through light from a window. As a fan, the best way to find clues about what the series has In store is through analyzing the title sequence. </p> </h6>
