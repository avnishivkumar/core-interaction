      <h3><p> OFFF Barcelona isn't a tv series but its promos and featurettes were too cool for me to ignore.
It is a Festival hosting innovative and international speakers and a meeting point for all talents around the world to come together. OFFF is a community conference for all those who are eager to learn and get inspired. It is a bunch of workshops, activities and performances for young people who aspire to be more creative. It is a meeting place for Offline and Online designers, Motion Designers, Thinkers, Sound Designers, Graphic Designers, Theorists, Developers, Professionals, and Students.

     <p>The OFFF Barcelona main title sequence is something I was very inspired by due to its concept, colours, costumes, set, colors and even music. The sequence was developed by a studio called Vallée Duhamel in 2017. It incorporates a story line, dancing, as well as interesting direction and set design.

<p> The sequence is directed by Eve Duhamel and Julien Vallée and is choreographed by Isabelle Boulanger. The title sequence depicts several different young characters interacting with props that make each of them unique. For example; a sweater, a paper airplane, a book, a ball.  The film focuses mainly on bold yet pastel and calming colors and basic geometric shapes. The typography too is a calming yellow that  surprises you with where its going to appear next. The credits flow around, behind, or in front of the actions of the characters which I thought was very interesting.</p>
  <p> The overlapping of people technique comes from the experimental 1982 short Tango by Zbigniew Rybszynski. The film depicts a single room getting more and more crowded as time passes and characters and their paths are intertwined. I especially enjoyed how each character is a different size so that they were able to fill up the whole room.</p>

  <p> However for this title sequence Vallée Duhamel twisted that original idea and added more elements for example costume sponsors including COS and Laugh by Lafaille. the influence of fashion and commercial advertising is present in every frame. The music, “Pressure” by Milk & Bone adds a calming, curious and youthful vibe to the whole piece.
