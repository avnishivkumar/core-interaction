      <p><h6> Television visual effects are finally something worth watching, after being over shadowed by the expensive cinema special effects. Some people call it the “Game of Thrones” effect. Ever since the HBO show came out with their quality and cinema worthy visual effects, the standards for other TV series’ were lifted and the expectations for television special effects became higher. </p>

      <p>The main reason behind television having worse off special effects is the tight TV budgets and an intense episodic production schedule. However, that is changing.

This is the era of TV and mini series’, the small screen is transforming into the preferred storytelling medium, and the once huge divide between cinema and TV visual effects has is quickly closing..</p>

    <p>Visual effects, now, is about being different and creative, to not do the same things that the audience has seen in every other movie and tv show.
“Sometimes it’s about not doing it the way audiences expect,” says John Ross, visual effects supervisor on FX series “Legion,” which is based on a Marvel comics character. “We were trying to avoid having powers come out of someone’s hands in the way you’ve seen it every other time.”</p>

<p> Westworld, a TV series where the characters progressively get younger, is a challenge for special effects artists. For Jay Worth, vfx supervisor on Westworld,  continuity fixes and de-aging the actors are just part of the challenge. “I think it’s pretty accurate to say ‘Game of Thrones’ changed things, made you think of what could be done on television,” says Worth. “You want to push yourself to another level when you see something great on a show.”
